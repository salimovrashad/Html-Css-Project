                Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries 
                from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit, the seeds 
                are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee. 
                The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable 
                product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically 
                steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.

                Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, 
                primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the 
                world and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, 
                French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). It is usually served hot, 
                although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes,
